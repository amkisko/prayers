## Dependency policy

Rules for adding, changing, or removing third-party packages. Apply across languages. Names vary by ecosystem; concepts do not.

Terminology:

- package manifest — declares intent (`gemspec`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `mix.exs`, etc.)
- lockfile — pins the resolved graph CI and developers install
- registry — published versions consumers resolve (`RubyGems`, `npm`, `crates.io`, `Hex`, etc.)
- hot path — code on the security, auth, crypto, IO, or request/response boundary users rely on

Stop until one of these applies before adding a dependency:

- stdlib or the framework for this tree already covers it;
- an installed transitive dependency already covers it without a second library for the same job;
- the feature needs a new package and tests will prove behavior.

Run dependency-audit for direct dependency changes, graph audits, releases with hot-path package changes, and plausible dependency vulnerability or exploitation signals found during ordinary work. Keep the evidence and assessment in the live-work or dependency record.
